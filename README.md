**VIRTUAL PET SIMULATOR PROJECT**
**Overview**
Develop a console application in C# that simulates caring for a virtual pet. This comprehensive project encompasses fundamental programming concepts like basic program structure and console, I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.

**Detailed Project Features**
1. Pet Creation:
 Allow the user to choose a pet type (e.g., cat, dog, rabbit) and give it a name.
 Display a welcome message that includes the pet's type and name.
2. Pet Care Actions:
 Implement actions such as:
 Feeding: Decreases hunger and slightly increases health.
 Playing: Increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.
 Resting: Improves health and decreases happiness slightly.
 Each action should modify the pet's stats accordingly and display a message describing the action's effect.
3. Pet Status Monitoring:
 Track and display the pet’s stats: hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
 Implement a status check that warns the user if any stat is critically low or high.
4. Time-Based Changes:
 Simulate the passage of time, where each action represents the passing of an hour.
 Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction.
5. Enhanced Interaction Logic:
 Implement consequences for neglect, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
 Include special messages or events based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if it is too hungry).
6. User Interface and Experience:
 Develop a simple, clear, and user-friendly console interface.
 Include instructions for the user on how to interact with the application.
